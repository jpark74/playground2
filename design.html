							<h1>Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
							<h3>Book cover illustration</h3>
						
							<p>	
								It is my digital illustration assignment for publishing. I chose the Little Red Riding Hood book for this assignment. From the ideation and sketches, I considered how can get attention without spoiler. My target was the people who haven't read this book, so it was the important part. Coming up with ideas was fun because I had to think both of spoiler and evoking curiosity.
							</p>
							<P>
								At the end of the research, leaving a small hint about the story is the way. I started to sketch several thumbnails that have a small hint of the story. Finally, one thumbnail that the girl walking through the forest chosen because it contains less information about the story but still has a hint. Placing Red riding hood on the front side gets attention and makes them think where is she heading to. I thought that audience will concentrate on the story more because the book cover gives them curiosity. I placed Grandma's house on the backside. When the audience has done read the book, they will recognize the back of the cover is Grandma's house. I think this is a fun point.
							</P>
								
							<p>	
								I also created the title logo for the book. I wanted to design matched typography with the illustration. I gave them curved tails and connected lines, and I think it blends with the overall cover design.

							<h1>Bready Bakery</h1>
							<h3>Bakery brand design</h3>
						
							<p>	
							Bready is a bakery & cafe brand. People enjoy fresh baked goods and drink coffee at the same time. What a great healing place! The idea started from the small desire want to go somewhere and eat delicious bread and cakes with a tasty beverage. Especially lockdown situation.
							</p>

							<p>
							I sketched out some bread like a croissant and milk bread. In the beginning, it was just bread, but I tried something cute. This is because that is what I do. I added eyes and drew more bread. The group of bread enough to be a brand element, I started to design a logo for it. The initial plan of the brand name was Sweet bakery, literally, I thought about sweet bread. However, I recognized that the character inside of the logo didn't match well with the name. I decided to change the name to Bready. It sounds like more names of the character. I liked it. About the colour, there were a lot of strugglings with the colour choice. I chose the red colours because that is a very classic colour for bakery brands. But I wanted to make a unique brand. SO I chose purple for the main. Pink and blue are the support colours. Keeping the bakery brand's identity by the name and the character inside of the logo. I simplified the bread's shapes and made them to the pattern. This pattern used for packaging and social media content.

							<h1>Jelly</h1>
							<h3>Branding</h3>
						
							<p>	
								'Jelly' is a shoe brand making comfortable shoes for walking. Jelly's strength is soft sole like a jelly. I targeted 8 to 13 years old children.

							</p>
							<p>
								I chose the jellyfish for the main imagery of the brand because the jellyfish is fit to the name of the brand and products. Not only this reason, but also I thought that could be appealed to the young target audience by using the dreamy colour of the jellyfish. I started sketching a logo with the wave lines that refer movement of the jellyfish. Also, I sketched several elements for the brand identity. I created jellyfish and flowery shapes inside of the jellyfish graphics. I created a cute pattern with those graphics. I applied that pattern to the product (shoes).
								For dreamy imagery of the jellyfish, I chose the bright pastel colours. Sky blue and pink are the support colour for the background.

							<h3>Team Project / Typography / Type design / Poster design</h3>
						
							<p>	
								We created a unique font for display typography.
								We created a sharp and broken feeling with triangular cuts for each character. It has sharply curved edges and tails.

							<div class="textgap"></div>
								<h3> Part of the project</h3>
								<p>
								I took the part of sketching upper case characters and converted them to vectors with Glyphs. By using Glyphs, I adjusted the kerning and tracking to make a perfect font to use. I created a typography poster to advertise the Breakie font. It is designing to represent the identity of the font.
